					<h1>RobodyCare</h1>
					<h3>Mind-Controlled Healthcare System with Biofeedback</h3>
					<p>
						<small>Created for <a href="http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/hardware/">Big Ideas at Berkeley</a></small>

				<section>
					<h2>Hello There</h2>
					<p>RobodyCare uses machine learning and efficient algorithms to improve people's mental and physical health.</p>
					<p>The mind-controlled massager uses <strong>EEG brain waves</strong>, <strong>3D printing</strong> and <strong>embedded systems</strong> to help both diagnosis and treatment of stress and chronic pain. It exemplifies the democratization of data-driven healthcare methods at low cost.</p>

					<h2>Current problem</h2>
					<p>We encounter numerous significant factors leading to <strong>stressful</strong> days.</p>
					<p> According to the National Institutes of Mental Health, 75% of all individuals with <strong>depression</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong> will first begin to experience these symptoms before the age of 22.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What can we do about it?</h2>
					<p>Several studies have shown that through <strong>massage therapy</strong>, specifically around the head region, individuals have reported feeling less depressed and angry, sleeping better, and having more energy and focus throughout their day.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Proposed innovation</h2>
					<p>We propose to create a new <strong>integrated biofeedback device</strong>, which will stimulate user’s head and other important acupuncture points on the user’s body in order to sooth the user both physically and mentally.</p>

					<h2>Data driven</h2>
					<p>One of the further possible and exciting extensions of this project is the ability to help diagnose particular types of chronic pain.</p>
					<p>With <strong>machine learning</strong> and efficient algorithms, we would be able to differentiate pain in different parts of the body, thus activate corresponding vibrational motors when certain types of pain is detected.</p>
